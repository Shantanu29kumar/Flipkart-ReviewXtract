Flipkart Reviews Sentiment Analysis using Python Sentiment analysis of Flipkart is the process of analyzing customer feedback and reviews on Flipkart products and 
its services. 
In our case, it is boAt Rockerz 400. 
This study aims to understand the overall sentiment of customers towards the product which is sold by Flipkart, including their levels of satisfaction, 
dissatisfaction, and areas for improvement. It is possible for Flipkart as well boAt to use this data to improve the customer experience, their product offerings,
and their overall business strategy by using this information.

Sentiment analysis can be performed using various machine learning techniques, such as natural language processing (NLP) and text classification.
"tqdm" is a Python function that preprocesses text data. The function takes in a list of text sentences called "text_data". It uses the tqdm library 
to display a progress bar for the processing loop. The function performs the following steps for each sentence in the input:

1. Removes punctuations from the sentence using a regular expression (re.sub).
2. Tokenizes the sentence into words using nltk.word_tokenize.
3. Converts each word to lowercase and removes stopwords (common words such as "the", "a", etc.).
4. Joins the remaining words back into a sentence and adds it to the list "written_text".

Finally, the function returns the list "written_text" which contains the preprocessed sentences.
Then we generate a word cloud visualization from a column of text data in a Pandas DataFrame called "data". 
The text data is filtered to only include rows where the value in the "label" column is equal to 1. 
The filtered text data is concatenated into a single string, "strong_word", which is then passed to a WordCloud object. 
The WordCloud object generates the word cloud visualization and displays it using Matplotlib's imshow() function. 
The size of the figure is set to 20x10 inches, and the axis is turned off.

Last but not least, we train our data using a Decision Classifier and then measure its accuracy.

The future scope and usability of sentiment analysis is broad and holds great promise as it has a wide range of applications 
in various industries and fields. The results of sentiment analysis on Flipkart can provide valuable insights into customer satisfaction, 
product popularity, and customer preferences. This information can be used by Flipkart and boAt to make data-driven decisions, 
improve customer experiences, and increase customer loyalty.
